Dear Moe's Partners, <br>

We have successfully shipped a ticket printer to your location. In preparation for its arrival, please review the instructions below to setup your printer. It is very important that you first update your Store Profile in the <a href="http://portal.splickit.com">Merchant Portal</a> with the correct pricing, hours, taxes, direct deposit, etc. before your location will be activated. Please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@dummy.com"> support@dummy.com </a> if you have not yet recieved your Merchant Portal logins, please contact us.<p>

<h3><b> Printer Setup Step by Step Guide: </b></h3>

<ol>

<li> Remove printer from box and identify the printer, power cord and instructions. </li>

<li> Plug power cord into back of the printer set near tortilla press. </li>

<li> Plug power cord into a nearby outlet. (Internet is NOT required) </li>

<li> Turn power switch located on the back of the printer to the "ON" position. </li>

<li> Once it has fully powered on, the printer should automatically print your store address and phone number. Please confirm that all of this information is correct! If it is not correct, please contact us immediately at 303.481.3656. </li>

<li> If the information printed is correct, you should receive a test order from Splickit sometime later in the day. </li>

<li> If the test order is successfully received and your Store Profile has been updated in the Merchant Portal, then your location will be activated in the next 24 hours. You will receive a confirmation email once your store has been successfully activated. </li>

<li> In-store marketing material will be arriving later this month. Please make sure to give the signage prominent placement in a clear line of sight for your customers. 45% of all initial downloads come from people learning about the app from in-store signage. </li>

</ol>

Finally, please review the links below for more detail on printer setup and information on entering orders into your POS system. <br>
